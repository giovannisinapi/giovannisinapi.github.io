## Research

Inverse problems is a field of study dealing with inversion of models or data. An inverse problem is a mathematical framework that is used to obtain information about a physical object or system from observed measurements. The solution to this problem is useful because it generally provides information about a physical parameter that we cannot directly observe. Applications of inverse problems can be found in medical imaging, geophysics, computer vision, astronomy, nondestructive testing, and many others.

A typical inverse problem is to recover the coefficients of a partial differential equation (PDE) i.e. physical properties like medium propagation, internal density distribution, etc from measurements on the boundary of the domain. My research has been on unique recovery of coefficients in an elliptic PDE defined on a bounded domain from the knowledge of boundary measurements which are encoded through the so-called Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map. The main emphasis of my research has been on the the unique recovery of coefficient for two different families of elliptic PDEs under low regularity or degeneracy of the coefficients.

### Notes 
[This](documents/HT_uniqueness_exposition.pdf) is an exposition on Haberman and Tataru's proof on uniqueness in the inverse conductivity problem. I wrote it mainly to teach myself the techniques used in their proof. 

### Talks

The following talks were given at the GSAS (Graduate Student Analysis Seminar) at Department of Mathematics, University of Washington. GSAS is a great, low-stakes forum for graduate students in the area of analysis to share their reading and research in the form of a seminar talk.
