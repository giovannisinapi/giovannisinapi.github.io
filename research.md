## Research

Inverse problems is a field of study dealing with inversion of models or data. An inverse problem is a mathematical framework that is used to obtain information about a physical object or system from observed measurements. The solution to this problem is useful because it generally provides information about a physical parameter that we cannot directly observe. Applications of inverse problems can be found in medical imaging, geophysics, computer vision, astronomy, nondestructive testing, and many others.
