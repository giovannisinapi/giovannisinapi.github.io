#### Math 324, Fall 2015
This page contains the course syllabus, the homework schedule, a course calendar and links to review material for 
Math 324 for Fall 2015.
Each week, I will be posting homework assignments and other review materials. Please check back regularly.

##### About the course

This course is a continuation of Math 126. The focus is
mostly on integration in multiple variables. We’ll discuss double and triple
integrals in different coordinates systems in chapter 15. Then we’ll cover gradient
and derivatives in chapter 14. Finally, in chapter 16, we’ll introduce line
integrals, vector fields, surface integrals and ultimately how to calculate them
using Green’s theorem, Stokes’ theorem and Gauss' theorem. This course is endloaded,
in that there are a lot of big topics in the last two weeks

Please have a look at the [course details](documents/syllabus_math324_fall2015.pdf) and [course schedule](documents/CourseSchedulefall15.pdf).
