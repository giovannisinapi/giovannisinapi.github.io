## Welcome!

My name is Giovanni Sinapi. 

I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, Seattle. My thesis supervisor is [Gunther Uhlmann](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~gunther/). My broad area of research is inverse problems arising in partial differential equations. I am specifically interested in the uniqueness aspect of elliptic inverse problems.

Before joining the PhD program, I studied at [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/) in Bangalore where I graduated with a MSc degree in Mathematics. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate studies from [University of Mumbai](http://www.mu.ac.in/) where I obtained a BSc degree in Mathematics. 

 Please take a look at my my [github profile](https://github.com/iyer-karthik) or reach out to me at <karthik2@uw.edu>
