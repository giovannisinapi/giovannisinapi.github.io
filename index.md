## Welcome!

I am a Data Scientist and Industrial Engineer based in Seattle.

I obtained my Master of Science of Industrial \& Systems Engineering from the [Department of Industrial \& Systems Engineering](https://ise.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, Seattle. Before joining the Master program, I studied at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_diet/en) in Rome where I graduated with a BSc degree in Engineering Management.

My main area of research and applications include supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing and deep reinforcement learning. 

Extremely passionate about writing, jazz and reading.
