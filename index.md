## Welcome!

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_photo_square.jpg">

I am a transportation planner and researcher based in Los Angeles, California. 

I've been fortunate enough to work on and study a variety of different topics within transportation, including the famous 'Carmageddon,' Los Angeles' innovative ExpressPark proero traffic safety initiative. In my spare time, I've undertaken other fun transportation-related projects, such as the Los Angeles Bus Map.
