## Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in Seattle. My thesis supervisor<br> is [Gunther Uhlmann](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~gunther/). My broad area of research is inverse problems arising in partial differential equations. I am specifically interested in the uniqueness aspect of elliptic inverse problems.

Before joining the PhD program, I studied at [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/) in Bangalore where I graduated with<br> a MSc degree in Mathematics. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate studies from [University of Mumbai](http://www.mu.ac.in/) where I obtained<br> a BSc degree in Mathematics.
