Welcome to Math 324! This webpage contains the course syllabus, the homework schedule, a course calendar and links to review material. 
Each week, I will be posting homework assignments and other review materials. Please check back regularly.

## About the course

This course is a continuation of Math 126. The emphasis is mostly
on integration in multiple variables. We will discuss  iterated integrals (double and
triple), a bit of gradient and partial derivatives, line integrals, vector fields, surface integrals and  how to calculate
them using the theorem of Gauss, Green and Stokes. This course is 'end-loaded', in that there
are a lot of big topics in the last 2 weeks. Be ready for that!

Please have a look at this for details about the course policies, course structure and grade distribution.
